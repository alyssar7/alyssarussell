                    Mitigating the effects of human-induced climate change requires the reduction of greenhouse gases. Policymakers must balance the need for mitigation with the need to sustain and develop the economy. To make informed decisions regarding mitigation strategies, policymakers rely on estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC), which represents the marginal damage from increased emissions; the SCC must be greater than the marginal abatement cost for mitigation to be economically desirable. To determine the SCC, damage functions translate projections of carbon and temperature into economic losses. We examine the impact that four damage functions commonly employed in the literature have on the SCC. Rather than using an economic growth model, we convert the CO2 pathways from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) into temperature projections using a three-layer, energy balance model and subsequently estimate damages under each RCP using the damage functions. We estimate marginal damages for 2020â€“2100, finding significant variability in SCC estimates between damage functions. Despite the uncertainty in choosing a specific damage function, comparing the SCC estimates to estimates of marginal abatement costs from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) indicates that reducing emissions beyond RCP6.0 is economically beneficial under all scenarios. Reducing emissions beyond RCP4.5 is also likely to be economically desirable under certain damage functions and SSP scenarios. However, future work must resolve the uncertainty surrounding the form of damage function and the SSP estimates of marginal abatement costs to better estimate the economic impacts of climate change and the benefits of mitigating it.

                    <b>The Effect of Child-Staff Ratios on Care Choice, Availability and Parent Employment</b>.

                    Child-staff ratios are an important and common childcare regulation that indicate the maximum number of children allowed to be cared for by each staff member. They are intended to improve the quality of care in childcare centres, but they might have some unintended consequences. This study analyzes whether child-staff ratios cause a substitution away from regulated centre-based care toward less-regulated (and lower quality) home-based care. I also analyze whether ratios have an impact on childcare availability and parent employment. I use Canadian survey data and utilize variation in child-staff ratios across provinces and by child age to identify these effects. I find that stringent ratios decrease the probability that parents will use centre-based care for their child, and, interestingly, this effect is larger for high-income parents. I also find that stringent ratios cause parents (especially mothers) to work less. Overall, this study highlights several drawbacks to an important childcare regulation that should be considered as new childcare policy is developed.
